# R6 Siege Marketplace Helper

A browser extension that displays current buy and sell prices directly on Rainbow Six Siege marketplace item cards, helping you make better trading decisions.


## How It Works

The extension intercepts GraphQL requests from the Ubisoft marketplace and displays the pricing information directly on item cards:

- **"Buy now"**: Lowest available sell price (you can buy at this price)
- **"Sell now"**: Highest available buy order (you can sell at this price)
